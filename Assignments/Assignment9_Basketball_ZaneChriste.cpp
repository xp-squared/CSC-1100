        * Iteration1: i=0 starting position 
		* *(pArr + i)               : first array element (index 0). The alternative way to write this is pArr[i], and in the 1st iteration, its pArr[0] 
		* ((i + 2) * 10) + (i + 1)  : ((0 + 2) * 10) + (0 + 1) => (2 * 10) + (1) => 20 + 1 = 21
		* Thus, in the 1st iteration, we are setting the 1st position (index 0) element of the array pArr to 21
		*
		* Iteration2: i=1 starting position 
		* *(pArr + i)               : Second array element (index 1), in other words, pArr[1] 
		* ((i + 2) * 10) + (i + 1)  : ((1 + 2) * 10) + (1 + 1) => (3 * 10) + (1) => 30 + 2 = 32
		* Thus, in the 2nd iteration, we are setting the 2nd position (index 1) element of the array pArr to 32
		*
		* This continues until we reach game 5 (iteration 5)
		* 
		* Iteration5: i=4 starting position 
		* *(pArr + i)               : fifth array element (index 4), in other words, pArr[4] 
		* ((i + 2) * 10) + (i + 1)  : ((4 + 2) * 10) + (4 + 1) => (6 * 10) + (5) => 60 + 5 = 65
		* Thus, in the 5th iteration, we are setting the 5th position (index 4) element of the array pArr to 65
